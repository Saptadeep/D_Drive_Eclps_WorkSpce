  Answer to the bonus question: how much can you trust the selection of alpha?
  
  Alpha parameters maximising the generalization score on different
  subsets of the data:
  [fold 0] alpha: 0.10405, score: 0.53573
  [fold 1] alpha: 0.05968, score: 0.16278
  [fold 2] alpha: 0.10405, score: 0.44437
  
  Answer: Not very much since we obtained different alphas for different
  subsets of the data and moreover, the scores for these alphas differ
  quite substantially.
